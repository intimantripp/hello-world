Getting Grips


Hello there. I am typing to you. Yes. You. 

Let us imagine, for 10 seconds, a world where everyone isn't a dick to each other. Where everyone is considerate, where people don't try to one up each other. Where health is not a commodity, but a right. Where representation isn't an uphill battle, but a downhill slide. Where parking wardens don't exist. Where people obey the rules without the need for them to be enforced. Where judges dictate what is fair or correct before those involved act, not after, and where everyone is healthy and fed. 

This is a good world. It is, perhaps, a perfect world. More perfect than the one we have now. More so, it is an achievable world. 

Let us achieve it, one person at a time.

Here goes.
